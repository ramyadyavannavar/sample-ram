            <p>Use sensory words like 'crisp', 'fresh' or 'warm', 'velvety' or 'soft' versus 'sharp' to describe your sensory experience when smelling a particular note. Perfumers don't like using these terms as they are 'subjective' and 'personal'.</p>

                <p>Eau De Parfum is one of the most popular types of fragrances due to its balance between longevity and subtlety. EDP typically contains 15-20% perfume oil, which makes it last longer on the skin, usually around six to eight hours or more. Itâ€™s suitable for evening wear or special occasions.</p>

                        <p>Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically ethanol or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The intensity and longevity of a fragrance is based on the concentration, intensity, and longevity of the aromatic compounds, or perfume oils, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent.
                             Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance's approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of the final product.</p>
